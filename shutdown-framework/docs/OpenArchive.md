## Short Intro

Save, developed by OpenArchive, is a privacy-focused mobile application that empowers users to securely verify, share, and archive their mobile media. The app ensures media integrity through SHA-256 hashing, secures uploads with TLS and Tor, and supports metadata and licensing options for proper attribution. Whether a journalist, activist, or content creator, Save is designed to protect digital media while ensuring long-term accessibility and authenticity.

## Feature

- [X] [Background encryption]("Encryption converts information into a coded format that only someone with the correct key can decode, ensuring security even if the data is intercepted. Unlike a password, which controls access, encryption protects the actual content, making it unreadable without the key, even if access is gained.")
- [X] Media Authentication: Verifies the integrity of your media using [SHA-256 hashing](#){ title="SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that converts input data into a fixed 256-bit (64-character) hash. It's deterministic, secure, and widely used for data integrity, password hashing, and blockchain. It ensures pre-image resistance (hard to reverse), collision resistance (unique outputs), and fast computation." } 
- [X] Secure Uploads: Ensures safe media transfer via TLS or Tor.
- [X] Metadata and Licensing: Add Creative Commons licenses and metadata for proper attribution.
- [X] Flexible Archiving: Choose between public archives, private repositories, or personal storage.
- [X] Open Source: Transparent code available for review and contribution.
- [X] User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for both beginners and advanced users.
- [ ] Metadata removal
