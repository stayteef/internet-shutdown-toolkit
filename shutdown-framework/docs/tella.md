## Short Intro

Tella is an application that functions as a File Manager, Camera, and Recorder. It automatically encrypts photos, videos, and audio recordings when they are captured. Users can also import existing files into Tella for encryption.

The app includes features such as the ability to change its icon, and files stored within Tella are not accessible through the phoneâ€™s default gallery or file manager. 

This helps protect sensitive content, such as documentation of human rights violations or news material, in situations where devices may be searched. During internet shutdowns, Tella can be used to archive files securely until connectivity is restored and the content can be shared.

## Feature

Unlike a password, which controls access, encryption protects the actual content, making it unreadable without the key, even if access is gained.")
- [X] Hide App icon on home screen
- [ ] Metadata Removal
- [X] [Metadata](#){ title="tooltip of why metadata is important" } Removal

## <span style="color:red">I think we can have some icons of "non-profit" and "for profit"/ "open-source", anything related to how 'ethical' the tool is, with inapplicable ones greyed out, for each tool </span>.

!!! warning "related risks"

    If the user loses their lock, it is not possible to regain access to Tella and the files stored inside the app. The user has to uninstall and reinstall Tella, and all files will be lost. 

## Security and testing (about security audits and any usabilty testing)

Tella regularly ask independent security firms to audit our code to ensure it is robust and secure.
